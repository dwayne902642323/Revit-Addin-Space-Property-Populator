This VBA-driven spreadsheet is designed to compare load calculation data from Trane Trace 3D Plus outputs for large hospital air balance analyses and to 
determine the psychrometric state points of air streams at various locations along the airflow in an air handling unit. It calculates outside air 
ventilation in accordance with ASHRAE 170 and 62.1 and computes the return air conditions per space using custom VBA functions developed with insights 
from ChatGPTâ€™s o3-mini-high model. The spreadsheet contains multiple VBA modules, each implementing specific functions and subroutines that automate 
key calculations and streamline the analysis process. This is also a living document for each air handling unit that contains all information in a single
source for future reference and to hand off to design engineers for Revit modeling and to create air balance pressurization plans.
